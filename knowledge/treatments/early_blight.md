# Early Blight — Treatment Guide

## Chemical Control

### Fungicides (Primary)
- **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L water. Broad-spectrum protectant. Spray at 7-10 day intervals.
- **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Excellent protectant for early blight.
- **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 1.0 ml/L water. Systemic — provides curative action. Limit to 3 sprays/season.
- **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water. Systemic triazole fungicide.

### Combination Products
- **Mancozeb + Metalaxyl (Ridomil Gold):** 2.5 g/L. Good for early blight + late blight prevention.
- **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole (Amistar Top):** 1.0 ml/L. Premium broad-spectrum option.

### Spray Schedule
1. First spray: At first symptom appearance or when conditions favor disease
2. Protectant (Mancozeb/Chlorothalonil): Every 7-10 days
3. Systemic (Azoxystrobin): Every 14-21 days, maximum 3 applications
4. Alternate modes of action to prevent resistance

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Neem Oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm):** 3-5 ml/L. Moderate antifungal activity.
- **Trichoderma harzianum:** Soil drench 10 g/L or seed treatment 5 g/kg seed.
- **Bacillus subtilis:** Foliar spray 5 g/L. Biocontrol agent.
- **Baking soda spray:** 5 g sodium bicarbonate + 5 ml liquid soap per liter water (home remedy).

## Cultural Practices
- Remove and destroy infected lower leaves immediately
- Maintain adequate plant spacing (50-60 cm)
- Stake or cage plants to keep foliage off the ground
- Use drip irrigation — avoid wetting foliage
- Apply thick mulch (straw, plastic) to prevent soil splash
- Ensure balanced nutrition — nitrogen-stressed plants are more susceptible
- Practice 3-year crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops

## Prevention
- Use resistant varieties (e.g., 'Mountain Fresh', 'Defiant')
- Start preventive sprays before disease appears during humid weather
- Remove crop debris after harvest — the fungus overwinters in debris
- Adequate potassium nutrition improves disease resistance
- Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Mancozeb: ₹200-300
- Azoxystrobin: ₹600-800
- Amistar Top: ₹800-1,000
- Total season cost: ₹3,000-6,000 (6-10 sprays)
