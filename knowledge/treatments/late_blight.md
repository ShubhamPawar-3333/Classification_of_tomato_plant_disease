# Late Blight — Treatment Guide

## ⚠️ URGENT — Late blight requires IMMEDIATE action
Late blight can destroy an entire crop in 7-10 days. Begin treatment immediately upon detection. Do NOT wait for confirmation — spray first and assess later.

## Chemical Control

### Systemic Fungicides (Primary — use for active infection)
- **Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (Ridomil Gold MZ 68% WP):** 2.5 g/L water. Best combined systemic + protectant. Apply immediately.
- **Cymoxanil + Mancozeb (Curzate M8):** 3.0 g/L water. Translaminar action.
- **Dimethomorph 50% WP:** 1.0 g/L water. Cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor.
- **Mandipropamid (Revus):** 0.6 ml/L water. Excellent rainfastness.

### Protectant Fungicides (for prevention and continued protection)
- **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L water. Use between systemic applications.
- **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Alternative protectant.
- **Copper Hydroxide 77% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Organic-compatible option.

### Emergency Spray Protocol
1. **Day 0 (detection):** Ridomil Gold MZ immediately
2. **Day 5:** Curzate M8 or Dimethomorph
3. **Day 10:** Mancozeb (protectant)
4. **Day 15:** Ridomil Gold MZ (repeat systemic)
5. Continue 5-7 day intervals until conditions become unfavorable

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Copper-based sprays:** Bordeaux mixture 1% or Copper Hydroxide 2 g/L. Apply preventively — limited curative action.
- **Trichoderma viride:** Soil application. Partial biocontrol.
- **Phosphorous acid (Potassium Phosphonate):** 3 ml/L. Induces plant defense responses.
- **Note:** Organic options are primarily preventive. Organic control ALONE is often insufficient for active late blight infections.

## Cultural Practices
- Remove and BURN (do not compost) all infected plant material
- Improve air circulation with wider spacing
- Avoid overhead irrigation at all costs
- Scout fields daily during high-risk weather
- Destroy volunteer potato and tomato plants nearby
- Time planting to avoid peak late blight season

## Prevention
- Use resistant varieties where available
- Begin preventive sprays when weather forecasts indicate cool, wet conditions
- Monitor weather: >10 hours leaf wetness + temperatures 10-25°C = HIGH RISK
- Ensure good drainage in the field
- Destroy all crop debris immediately after harvest
- Do not save seed from infected crops

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Ridomil Gold: ₹800-1,000
- Curzate M8: ₹600-800
- Mancozeb: ₹200-300
- Total emergency season cost: ₹5,000-10,000 (8-12 sprays)
