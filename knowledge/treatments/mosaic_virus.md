# Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV) — Treatment Guide

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT — No chemical cure exists for ToMV
Like all viral diseases, ToMV CANNOT be treated with chemicals. Management relies entirely on prevention and sanitation.

## Sanitation (THE primary control strategy)

### Hygiene Protocols
- **Hand washing:** Wash hands with soap and water or dip in milk (20%) before handling plants. Milk protein inactivates ToMV.
- **Tool disinfection:** Soak pruning shears, knives, and stakes in 10% trisodium phosphate (TSP) or 10% bleach for 10 minutes.
- **No smoking:** Tobacco products can carry TMV, which cross-infects tomato. Do NOT smoke or use tobacco near tomato plants.
- **Dedicated clothing:** Use clean work clothes when entering tomato growing areas.

### Infected Plant Management
- Remove and destroy infected plants if infection is early and few plants are affected
- If infection is widespread, manage remaining plants — late infection has less yield impact
- Do NOT compost infected plant material — burn or dispose in sealed bags
- Do NOT save seed from infected plants

## Seed Treatment
- **Heat treatment:** Dry seeds at 70°C for 2-4 days. Reduces seed-borne virus significantly.
- **10% TSP soak:** Soak seeds in 10% trisodium phosphate for 15 minutes, then rinse thoroughly.
- **Acid extraction:** When saving seed, use acid fermentation method (HCl 1% for 30 min) to deactivate surface virus.
- **Certified seed:** Purchase virus-tested, certified seed from reputable sources.

## Organic / Biological Approaches
- **Milk spray:** 10-20% skim milk solution sprayed on plants may reduce viral spread by coating surfaces.
- **Cross-protection:** Inoculation with mild strains of ToMV can protect against severe strains (research level only).
- No biocontrol agents are effective against ToMV.

## Cultural Practices
- Avoid handling plants more than necessary
- Handle healthy plants FIRST, infected plants LAST during any field operation
- Remove and destroy solanaceous weeds (nightshade, jimsonweed) near the field
- Practice strict crop rotation (2-3 years without solanaceous crops)
- Clean and disinfect greenhouse structures between seasons

## Prevention
- **Use ToMV-resistant varieties:** Many modern hybrids carry the Tm-2^2 resistance gene.
  - Resistant varieties effectively prevent ToMV infection
  - Always check seed catalog for ToMV resistance ratings
- Buy certified virus-free transplants
- Train workers in proper hygiene protocols
- Post "No Smoking" signs in growing areas
- Disinfect all reusable stakes and equipment between seasons

## Cost Estimate
- Seed treatment costs: ₹50-100 per kg seed
- TSP (Trisodium Phosphate): ₹200-300 per kg (lasts many uses)
- Resistant seed premium: ₹200-500 extra per packet
- Total prevention cost: ₹500-1,500 (mainly seed and sanitation)
