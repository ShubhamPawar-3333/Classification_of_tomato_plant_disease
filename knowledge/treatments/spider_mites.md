# Spider Mites (Two-Spotted) — Treatment Guide

## Chemical Control (Acaricides)

### Miticides (Primary)
- **Abamectin 1.8% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water. Very effective. Translaminar action reaches mites on leaf undersides.
- **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC (Oberon):** 0.5 ml/L water. Excellent for mites + whiteflies. Inhibits lipid biosynthesis.
- **Fenazaquin 10% EC (Magister):** 1.5-2.0 ml/L water. Quick knockdown.
- **Propargite 57% EC (Omite):** 2.0 ml/L water. Contact acaricide.

### Important Notes
- Mites develop resistance FAST — never use the same acaricide twice in a row
- Rotate at least 3 different modes of action per season
- Spray must reach leaf undersides where mites live
- Use high-volume sprays for good coverage

### Spray Schedule
1. Spray immediately upon detecting stippling or webbing
2. Repeat at 5-7 day intervals (mites reproduce rapidly)
3. Rotate acaricides with every application
4. Continue until no live mites are found for 2 consecutive scouting visits

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Neem Oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm):** 3-5 ml/L. Disrupts mite feeding and reproduction. Apply every 5-7 days.
- **Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Effective at temperatures below 35°C. Do NOT use with oil sprays.
- **Predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis):** Release at 10-20 per plant. Best biological control option.
- **Insecticidal soap:** 10-20 g/L water. Contact kill — must hit mites directly.
- **Water sprays:** Strong jet of water dislodges mites. Effective early in infestation.

## Cultural Practices
- **Increase humidity:** Overhead misting (if no foliar disease risk) discourages mite buildup
- **Reduce dust:** Wet roadways and field borders — dusty conditions favor mites
- **Adequate irrigation:** Water-stressed plants are much more susceptible
- **Remove heavily infested leaves:** Bag and destroy
- **Weed management:** Remove broadleaf weeds that serve as mite reservoirs

## Prevention
- Scout regularly — check leaf undersides with a hand lens
- Dusty conditions are a warning sign — increase monitoring during dry spells
- Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that kill natural enemies of mites
- Maintain plant health with balanced nutrition and adequate water
- Use reflective mulch — repels mites and whiteflies

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Abamectin: ₹400-600
- Spiromesifen (Oberon): ₹800-1,000
- Neem Oil: ₹300-400
- Total season cost: ₹3,000-6,000 (5-8 sprays)
