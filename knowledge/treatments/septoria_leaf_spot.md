# Septoria Leaf Spot — Treatment Guide

## Chemical Control

### Fungicides (Primary)
- **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L water. Most cost-effective protectant. Spray every 7-10 days.
- **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Excellent for Septoria control.
- **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 1.0 ml/L water. Systemic — provides curative action for recent infections.
- **Propiconazole 25% EC:** 1.0 ml/L water. Systemic triazole.

### Combination Strategy
- Alternate protectants (Mancozeb, Chlorothalonil) with systemics (Azoxystrobin) every 2 weeks
- Start spraying before disease appears in wet seasons
- Never use same mode of action more than 3 times consecutively

### Spray Schedule
1. Preventive spray at flowering/early fruit set
2. Every 7-10 days during wet weather
3. Extend to 14 days during dry weather
4. Continue until 2 weeks before final harvest

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Copper Hydroxide 77% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Moderate protection.
- **Bordeaux Mixture 1%:** Traditional copper fungicide.
- **Bacillus subtilis:** 5 g/L water as foliar spray.
- **Trichoderma harzianum:** Soil drench 10 g/L.
- **Compost tea:** Foliar spray — contains beneficial microbes that compete with Septoria.

## Cultural Practices
- **Remove infected lower leaves:** Strip leaves showing spots — this is the most effective cultural measure.
- Mulch heavily to prevent rain splash from soil to lower leaves
- Stake or cage plants to keep foliage upright
- Use drip irrigation — avoid overhead watering
- Ensure adequate spacing (50-60 cm)
- Avoid working in fields when foliage is wet

## Prevention
- Plant resistant varieties where available
- Practice 3-year crop rotation
- Remove all tomato debris at end of season
- Destroy solanaceous weeds (nightshade, ground cherry)
- Solarize soil in summer if Septoria has been a recurring problem
- Start lower-leaf pruning early, before any symptoms appear

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Mancozeb: ₹200-300
- Chlorothalonil: ₹300-400
- Azoxystrobin: ₹600-800
- Total season cost: ₹2,500-5,000 (6-10 sprays)
