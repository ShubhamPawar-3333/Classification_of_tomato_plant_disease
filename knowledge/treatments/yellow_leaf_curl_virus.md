# Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV) — Treatment Guide

## ⚠️ CRITICAL — No cure exists for TYLCV
Once a plant is infected with TYLCV, it CANNOT be cured. All management focuses on preventing whitefly transmission and removing virus sources.

## Whitefly Control (THE primary management strategy)

### Insecticides for Whitefly
- **Imidacloprid 17.8% SL:** 0.3 ml/L water. Systemic neonicotinoid — soil drench or foliar spray.
- **Thiamethoxam 25% WG:** 0.3 g/L water. Systemic. Very effective against whiteflies.
- **Spiromesifen 22.9% SC (Oberon):** 0.5 ml/L water. Disrupts lipid biosynthesis in whiteflies.
- **Diafenthiuron 50% WP:** 1.0 g/L water. Effective contact + stomach action.
- **Pyriproxyfen 10% EC:** 1.0 ml/L. Insect growth regulator — disrupts whitefly reproduction.

### Spray Schedule for Whitefly Management
1. Seedling treatment: Imidacloprid soil drench at transplanting
2. Foliar sprays: Every 10-14 days during whitefly season
3. Rotate insecticide classes to prevent resistance
4. Target leaf undersides where whiteflies feed

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Yellow sticky traps:** Install at canopy height, 20-25 per acre. For monitoring AND mass trapping.
- **Neem Oil (Azadirachtin):** 3-5 ml/L water. Repels whiteflies and disrupts feeding.
- **Beauveria bassiana:** Entomopathogenic fungus — 5 g/L spray. Infects and kills whiteflies.
- **Encarsia formosa:** Parasitic wasp — releases in greenhouses for biological control.
- **Reflective silver mulch:** Repels whiteflies — reduces TYLCV incidence by 30-50%.

## Cultural Practices (MOST IMPORTANT)
- **Rogue infected plants:** Immediately remove and destroy any plant showing TYLCV symptoms. This reduces virus inoculum for healthy plants.
- **Whitefly-free transplants:** Use insect-proof nurseries with fine mesh (50-mesh) screens.
- **Crop-free period:** Maintain a 2-3 month host-free period to break the virus cycle.
- **Avoid planting near old infected fields:** Maintain distance from virus sources.
- **Remove alternative hosts:** Destroy nightshade, pepper, and bean plants near tomato fields.
- **Physical barriers:** Use 50-mesh insect-proof netting over nurseries and young transplants.

## Prevention
- **Use TYLCV-resistant varieties:** This is the BEST long-term strategy.
  - Resistant varieties: TY series, Arka Rakshak, Arka Samrat
- Plant during low whitefly pressure periods
- Use reflective mulch to repel whiteflies
- Install border crops (maize, sorghum) as windbreaks
- Treat seedlings with systemic insecticide before transplanting

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Imidacloprid: ₹300-400
- Oberon: ₹800-1,000
- Yellow sticky traps (25 nos): ₹500-700
- Total season cost: ₹4,000-8,000 (vector management is expensive)
