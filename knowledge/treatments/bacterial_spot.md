# Bacterial Spot — Treatment Guide

## Chemical Control

### Copper-based Fungicides (Primary)
- **Copper Oxychloride 50% WP:** 2.5-3.0 g/L water. Spray at 7-10 day intervals.
- **Copper Hydroxide 77% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Apply preventively or at first symptoms.
- **Bordeaux Mixture (1%):** 10g CuSO4 + 10g lime per liter. Traditional but effective.

### Antibiotics (Supplementary)
- **Streptomycin Sulphate 9% + Tetracycline 1% (Streptocycline):** 0.5 g per 10L water. Mix with copper spray. Do NOT use alone — promotes resistance.

### Spray Schedule
1. First spray: At transplanting or first symptoms
2. Repeat every 7-10 days during wet weather
3. Alternate copper products to reduce resistance buildup
4. Add sticker/spreader (Triton or Teepol) at 0.5 ml/L for better coverage

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Neem Oil (Azadirachtin 1500 ppm):** 3-5 ml/L water. Suppresses bacterial growth.
- **Pseudomonas fluorescens:** 10 g/L as foliar spray. Biocontrol agent.
- **Trichoderma viride:** Soil application at 2.5 kg/ha mixed with FYM for root zone protection.
- **Sour buttermilk spray:** Traditional method — 1 part buttermilk to 9 parts water.

## Cultural Practices
- Use certified disease-free seeds
- Hot water seed treatment: 50°C for 25 minutes (kills seed-borne bacteria)
- Avoid overhead irrigation — use drip
- Increase plant spacing for air circulation
- Remove and destroy infected plants immediately
- Crop rotation with non-solanaceous crops (3-year minimum)
- Avoid working in fields when plants are wet

## Prevention
- Use resistant or tolerant varieties where available
- Disinfect tools with 10% bleach solution between plants
- Avoid touching healthy plants after handling infected ones
- Mulch to prevent soil splash onto lower leaves
- Stake plants to keep foliage off the ground

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Copper Oxychloride: ₹200-300
- Streptocycline: ₹150-200
- Neem Oil: ₹300-400
- Total season cost: ₹2,000-4,000 (5-8 sprays)
