# Leaf Mold — Treatment Guide

## Chemical Control

### Fungicides (Primary)
- **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Good protectant for leaf mold.
- **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L water. Broad-spectrum protectant.
- **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water. Systemic — curative + protective.
- **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 1.0 ml/L water. Strobilurin fungicide with translaminar action.

### Spray Schedule
1. Begin at first sign of symptoms (yellow patches on upper leaf, mold on lower)
2. Protectant sprays every 7-10 days during humid weather
3. Systemic sprays every 14 days, maximum 3 applications per season
4. Focus spray on leaf undersides where spore production occurs

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Sulphur 80% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Effective fungicide acceptable for organic production.
- **Potassium Bicarbonate:** 5 g/L water. Disrupts fungal cell walls.
- **Bacillus subtilis:** 5 g/L foliar spray. Biocontrol agent.
- **Neem Oil:** 3-5 ml/L. Moderate antifungal effect.

## Cultural Practices (MOST IMPORTANT for Leaf Mold)
- **Improve ventilation:** This is the single most effective measure. Open greenhouse vents, install fans.
- **Reduce humidity:** Target <85% RH. Use dehumidifiers in greenhouses.
- **Increase plant spacing:** 50-60 cm between plants minimum.
- **Remove lower leaves:** Prune leaves below the first fruit truss.
- **Avoid overhead irrigation:** Use drip irrigation only.
- **Reduce condensation:** Heat greenhouses at night to prevent dew formation.
- **Remove infected leaves:** Bag them in the greenhouse to prevent spore dispersal.

## Prevention
- Use resistant varieties — many commercial varieties carry Cf resistance genes
- Sanitize greenhouse structures between crops with 10% bleach
- Avoid carrying spores on clothing — change when entering different greenhouses
- Monitor humidity daily — the key trigger is >85% RH for >6 hours
- Ensure proper greenhouse ventilation design

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Chlorothalonil: ₹300-400
- Difenoconazole: ₹500-700
- Sulphur: ₹150-200
- Total season cost: ₹2,000-4,000 (4-8 sprays)
