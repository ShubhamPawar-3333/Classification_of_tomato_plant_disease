# Target Spot — Treatment Guide

## Chemical Control

### Fungicides (Primary)
- **Chlorothalonil 75% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Best protectant for target spot.
- **Azoxystrobin 23% SC:** 1.0 ml/L water. Systemic — curative and protective.
- **Difenoconazole 25% EC:** 0.5 ml/L water. Effective systemic fungicide.
- **Mancozeb 75% WP:** 2.5 g/L water. Cost-effective protectant.

### Combination Strategy
- **Azoxystrobin + Difenoconazole (Amistar Top):** 1.0 ml/L. Premium option combining two modes of action.
- Alternate protectant and systemic fungicides
- Start treatment early — target spot is easier to prevent than cure

### Spray Schedule
1. Begin when conditions favor disease (warm, humid weather)
2. Protectant sprays every 7-10 days
3. Systemic sprays every 14 days (max 3 per season)
4. Spray both upper and lower leaf surfaces

## Organic / Biological Control
- **Copper Hydroxide 77% WP:** 2.0 g/L water. Moderate activity against target spot.
- **Bacillus subtilis:** 5 g/L foliar spray.
- **Trichoderma harzianum:** Soil drench 10 g/L for root zone protection.
- **Neem Oil:** 3-5 ml/L — supplementary use.

## Cultural Practices
- Remove infected leaves promptly
- Improve air circulation with wider spacing
- Use drip irrigation — avoid leaf wetness
- Mulch to prevent soil splash
- Remove crop debris thoroughly at end of season
- Destroy alternative host weeds near the field

## Prevention
- Avoid planting in fields with history of target spot
- Crop rotation (3 years) with non-host crops
- Avoid excessive nitrogen — promotes lush, susceptible foliage
- Scout regularly — target spot is often misdiagnosed as early blight
- Balanced fertilization with emphasis on potassium for disease resistance

## Cost Estimate (per acre per spray)
- Chlorothalonil: ₹300-400
- Amistar Top: ₹800-1,000
- Mancozeb: ₹200-300
- Total season cost: ₹2,500-5,000 (6-8 sprays)
