# Healthy Tomato Plant — Preventive Care Guide

## Proactive Disease Prevention Program

### Pre-Season Preparation
1. **Soil testing:** Test soil pH, nutrients, and nematode levels before planting
2. **Soil solarization:** Cover moist soil with clear plastic for 4-6 weeks in summer to kill pathogens
3. **Crop rotation:** Never plant solanaceous crops in the same spot for 3-4 years
4. **Variety selection:** Choose disease-resistant varieties suited to your region and season
5. **Certified seed/transplants:** Always use virus-tested, disease-free planting material

### Preventive Spray Schedule

#### Phase 1: Seedling to Transplanting
- Seed treatment: Thiram 2.5 g/kg or hot water treatment (50°C, 25 min)
- Seedling drench: Trichoderma viride 10 g/L at nursery stage
- Transplant dip: Imidacloprid 0.3 ml/L (for whitefly prevention)

#### Phase 2: Vegetative Growth
- Week 1-2 after transplanting: Copper Hydroxide 2 g/L (preventive)
- Week 3-4: Mancozeb 2.5 g/L (broad-spectrum protection)
- Neem Oil 3 ml/L every 2 weeks (pest deterrent)

#### Phase 3: Flowering to Fruiting
- Alternate Mancozeb and Chlorothalonil every 10-14 days
- Add acaricide (Abamectin 0.5 ml/L) if mite pressure detected
- Continue neem oil sprays for general pest management

#### Phase 4: Harvest
- Stop spraying systemic chemicals 7-14 days before harvest (check PHI)
- Use copper-based or organic products for late-season protection

### Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Principles
1. **Scout regularly:** Check plants 2-3 times per week
2. **Identify correctly:** Ensure proper disease identification before treatment
3. **Threshold-based spraying:** Do not spray unless pest/disease level exceeds economic threshold
4. **Biological control first:** Use biocontrol agents and cultural methods as first line of defense
5. **Chemical as last resort:** Use targeted, specific chemicals when needed
6. **Record keeping:** Maintain a spray diary for reference

### Nutrition Management
- **Basal dose:** 10 tonnes FYM/ha + balanced NPK based on soil test
- **Top dressing:** Split nitrogen applications at 30, 60, and 90 days
- **Micronutrients:** Foliar spray of boron, zinc, and iron if deficiency symptoms appear
- **Calcium:** Regular calcium sprays to prevent blossom end rot

### Water Management
- Use drip irrigation for efficient water use and disease prevention
- Irrigate in the morning to allow foliage to dry before evening
- Avoid water stress — maintain consistent soil moisture
- Ensure proper drainage to prevent root diseases

## Cost Estimate (per acre per season — preventive program)
- Preventive sprays: ₹2,000-3,000
- Fertilizers: ₹3,000-5,000
- IPM inputs (traps, biocontrol): ₹1,000-2,000
- Total preventive care: ₹6,000-10,000
