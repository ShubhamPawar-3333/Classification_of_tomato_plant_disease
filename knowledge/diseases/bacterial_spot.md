# Bacterial Spot (Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria)

## Overview
Bacterial spot is one of the most common and destructive diseases of tomatoes in warm, humid regions. It is caused by several species of Xanthomonas bacteria and affects leaves, stems, and fruits.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria (also X. euvesicatoria, X. gardneri, X. perforans)
- **Type:** Gram-negative bacterium
- **Survival:** Survives on infected seed, crop debris, and volunteer tomato plants

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Small, dark brown to black, water-soaked spots (1-3 mm) that may have a yellow halo. Spots become angular and may coalesce, causing leaf yellowing and defoliation.
- **Fruits:** Raised, scab-like lesions on green fruits that become brown and rough-textured. Fruit spots are typically 3-6 mm in diameter.
- **Stems:** Dark, elongated lesions on stems and petioles.
- **Progression:** Starts on lower leaves and moves upward. Severe infections cause significant defoliation, exposing fruits to sunscald.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 24-30°C (75-86°F) — optimal for bacterial multiplication
- **Humidity:** High humidity (>80%) and frequent rainfall
- **Spread:** Splashing rain, overhead irrigation, contaminated tools, and worker handling
- **Season:** Most severe during warm, rainy monsoon season (June-September in India)

## Disease Cycle
1. Bacteria overwinter in infected crop debris, seeds, or volunteer plants
2. Spread to healthy plants via rain splash, wind-driven rain, or mechanical contact
3. Bacteria enter through natural openings (stomata) or wounds
4. Multiply rapidly in warm, moist conditions
5. New lesions appear within 5-7 days of infection
6. Cycle repeats throughout the growing season

## Impact
- Yield losses of 10-50% in severe cases
- Reduced fruit quality and marketability
- Defoliation leads to sunscald on exposed fruits
- No resistant commercial varieties widely available

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra (Nashik, Pune, Solapur)
- Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh
- Tropical and subtropical regions worldwide
- Particularly severe in areas with >1000mm annual rainfall
