# Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)

## Overview
Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus is one of the most destructive viral diseases of tomato worldwide. It is transmitted by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci and causes severe stunting, leaf curling, and yield loss. Once infected, plants cannot be cured.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV)
- **Type:** Virus (Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae)
- **Vector:** Whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) — persistent, circulative transmission
- **Survival:** In whitefly vectors, infected plants, and alternative hosts (nightshade, pepper, beans)

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Severe upward curling and cupping of young leaves. Leaves become small, crinkled, and show prominent yellowing of leaf margins. Leaflets may curl into cup shapes.
- **Plant:** Severe stunting and bushy, compact growth habit. Internode shortening gives the plant a "bonsai" appearance.
- **Flowers:** Flower abortion or drop; reduced fruit set
- **Fruits:** Very few fruits produced; those that develop are small and unmarketable
- **Progression:** Symptoms appear 2-3 weeks after whitefly inoculation. Plants infected early produce almost no harvestable fruit.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 25-35°C (77-95°F) — warm conditions favor whitefly reproduction
- **Dry weather:** Low humidity conditions favor whitefly populations
- **Whitefly presence:** Direct correlation between whitefly population and virus spread
- **Monoculture:** Continuous tomato cropping increases virus inoculum
- **Season:** Summer and early monsoon (particularly February-June in India)

## Disease Cycle
1. Whiteflies acquire virus from infected plants during feeding (minimum 15-30 min)
2. Virus circulates in the whitefly body for 8-24 hours (latent period)
3. Viruliferous whiteflies transmit virus to healthy plants during feeding
4. Virus replicates in plant phloem tissue
5. Symptoms develop 2-3 weeks post-inoculation
6. Infected plants serve as virus source for further whitefly acquisition

## Impact
- Yield losses of 80-100% when plants are infected within 3 weeks of transplanting
- Plants infected before flowering produce virtually no fruit
- No cure once plants are infected — only prevention
- Whitefly resistance to insecticides is increasing globally

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra (Nashik, Pune, Jalgaon — major problem)
- All tropical and subtropical tomato-growing regions in India
- Mediterranean basin, Middle East, Central America
- Expanding range due to global spread of Bemisia tabaci
