# Target Spot (Corynespora cassiicola)

## Overview
Target spot of tomato is caused by the fungus Corynespora cassiicola. It produces distinctive concentric-ringed lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits. While often confused with early blight, target spot lesions tend to be smaller and more numerous.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Corynespora cassiicola
- **Type:** Fungus (Deuteromycete)
- **Survival:** Wide host range — survives on many crops and weeds (soybean, cotton, cucumber, papaya). Persists as mycelium in infected debris.

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Small (3-10 mm), circular to oval, brown lesions with concentric rings and a light tan center. Unlike early blight, lesions are often smaller, more numerous, and can appear on both young and old leaves. Lesions may have a water-soaked margin initially.
- **Stems:** Elongated, dark brown lesions on stems and petioles.
- **Fruits:** Small to medium, circular, depressed lesions on mature fruit. Lesions have concentric rings and may crack.
- **Progression:** Can appear at any stage. Rapid defoliation occurs when lesions coalesce.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 25-30°C (77-86°F) — warm temperatures
- **Humidity:** High humidity (>80%) and prolonged periods of leaf wetness
- **Overcast weather:** Cloudy conditions favor spore production
- **Dense planting:** Poor air circulation increases infection risk
- **Season:** Most common during monsoon and post-monsoon

## Disease Cycle
1. Conidia produced on infected plant debris or from alternative hosts
2. Spores are windborne and also spread by rain splash
3. Direct penetration of leaf surface; no wounds required
4. Incubation period of 5-10 days
5. Abundant spore production on lesion surfaces under high humidity
6. Multiple infection cycles per season

## Impact
- Yield losses of 20-40% from defoliation
- Often misdiagnosed as early blight, leading to wrong treatment
- Wide host range makes crop rotation challenging
- Increasing in importance in tropical tomato production

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu
- Tropical lowland tomato production areas
- Increasingly reported in Southeast Asia and Brazil
- Important in warm, humid production systems
