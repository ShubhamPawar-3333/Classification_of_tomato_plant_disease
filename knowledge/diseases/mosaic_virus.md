# Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV)

## Overview
Tomato Mosaic Virus is a highly stable and contagious viral disease that causes characteristic mosaic mottling patterns on leaves. Unlike most plant viruses, ToMV is primarily spread by mechanical contact rather than insect vectors, making it particularly problematic in greenhouse and nursery settings.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Tomato Mosaic Virus (ToMV), closely related to Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV)
- **Type:** Virus (Tobamovirus, family Virgaviridae)
- **Stability:** Extraordinarily stable — can survive on dry plant surfaces for years, on tools and hands for hours, and in soil for up to 2 years
- **Transmission:** Mechanical (hands, tools, clothing), seed-borne (up to 90%), NOT insect-transmitted

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Mosaic pattern of light and dark green areas (mottling). Young leaves may show a "fern leaf" symptom — narrow, elongated, and distorted. Leaves may curl downward.
- **Plant:** Stunting varies from mild to severe depending on strain and infection timing.
- **Fruits:** Internal browning ("brown wall"), uneven ripening, reduced size. Some strains cause yellow ring spots on fruits.
- **Young plants:** More severely affected — stunting, distortion, reduced vigor
- **Special feature:** Symptoms are often more visible in cool, cloudy conditions and may be masked in hot weather.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** Symptoms worse at 20-25°C (68-77°F); may be masked above 30°C
- **Mechanical contact:** Handling plants during transplanting, pruning, and harvesting
- **Contaminated seed:** Up to 90% seed transmission in some cultivars
- **Season:** Year-round, but symptoms most visible in cool seasons
- **Nursery operations:** High risk during seedling production

## Disease Cycle
1. Virus enters through wounds created during routine handling
2. Contaminated seed serves as primary inoculum source
3. Workers' hands, tools, and clothing spread virus from plant to plant
4. Virus multiplies in plant cells and spreads systemically
5. Symptoms appear 10-14 days after infection
6. Infected plants remain infectious throughout their life

## Impact
- Yield losses of 20-70% depending on strain and timing of infection
- Fruit quality severely affected (internal browning)
- No cure — infected plants must be managed, not treated
- Cross-contamination in nurseries can infect entire batches

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Worldwide distribution — one of the most common plant viruses
- Maharashtra (all tomato-growing regions)
- Particularly problematic in greenhouse and nursery operations
- Common wherever tomato is grown, especially with manual handling
