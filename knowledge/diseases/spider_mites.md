# Two-Spotted Spider Mite (Tetranychus urticae)

## Overview
Two-spotted spider mites are not a disease but a pest that causes significant damage to tomato leaves. They are tiny arachnids (not insects) that feed on leaf cells by piercing them and sucking out the contents, causing characteristic stippling and bronzing.

## Pest
- **Organism:** Tetranychus urticae
- **Type:** Arachnid (Acari: Tetranychidae)
- **Size:** Adults are 0.4 mm long, barely visible to the naked eye
- **Identification:** Two dark spots on the body, visible under magnification. Produces fine webbing on leaf undersides.

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Fine yellow-white stippling (tiny dots) on the upper leaf surface, caused by individual cell feeding. As damage progresses, leaves become yellow, bronzed, and dry. Fine silk webbing on undersides.
- **Severe damage:** Leaves become completely bronzed, dry, and papery. Plants may defoliate from bottom to top.
- **Fruits:** Not directly fed upon, but severe defoliation reduces fruit size and quality, and exposed fruits get sunscald.
- **Look for:** Tiny moving dots on leaf undersides; fine webbing between leaf veins.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 27-35°C (80-95°F) — hot, dry conditions favor rapid reproduction
- **Humidity:** Low relative humidity (<50%) — mites thrive in dry conditions
- **Drought stress:** Water-stressed plants are more susceptible
- **Dusty conditions:** Roadside plants and plants near construction are more affected
- **Season:** Peak in summer (March-June in India), hot dry spells

## Life Cycle
1. Females lay 100-200 eggs on leaf undersides
2. Eggs hatch in 2-5 days depending on temperature
3. Larvae → protonymph → deutonymph → adult in 7-14 days
4. Reproduction rate doubles every 5°C increase in temperature
5. One generation can be completed in as few as 7 days at 30°C
6. Populations can explode from near-zero to thousands per leaf in 2 weeks

## Impact
- Yield losses of 15-45% from severe infestations
- Reduced photosynthesis from cell damage
- Rapid population explosion in hot, dry weather
- Resistance to many acaricides develops quickly
- Often triggers secondary problems (sunscald, fruit cracking)

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra (especially in hot, dry regions — Vidarbha, Marathwada)
- All arid and semi-arid tomato-growing regions
- Common in greenhouse production worldwide
- Worst during prolonged dry spells or drought
