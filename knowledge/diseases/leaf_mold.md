# Leaf Mold (Passalora fulva / Cladosporium fulvum)

## Overview
Leaf mold is a common disease of tomatoes grown in greenhouses or high-tunnel environments with high humidity and poor air circulation. It primarily affects leaves but can also infect flowers and fruits in severe cases.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Passalora fulva (syn. Cladosporium fulvum, Fulvia fulva)
- **Type:** Fungus (Ascomycete)
- **Survival:** Survives as sclerotia or conidia on plant debris, greenhouse structures, and in soil for over a year

## Symptoms
- **Leaves (upper surface):** Pale green to yellowish, diffuse spots without a distinct border. Spots may coalesce into large yellow areas.
- **Leaves (lower surface):** Olive-green to grayish-brown velvety mold growth (spore masses). This is the most diagnostic feature.
- **Flowers/Fruits:** Rarely affected, but severe infections can cause blossom drop and leathery, dark spots on fruit stems.
- **Progression:** Starts on lower leaves and moves upward. Severely infected leaves curl, wither, and drop.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 22-25°C (72-77°F) — moderate temperatures
- **Humidity:** >85% relative humidity — critical factor
- **Air circulation:** Poor ventilation in greenhouses is the primary risk factor
- **Leaf wetness:** Prolonged leaf wetness from overhead irrigation or condensation
- **Season:** Year-round in greenhouses; late monsoon in open fields

## Disease Cycle
1. Conidia (spores) are produced abundantly on the lower leaf surface
2. Spores are dispersed by air currents, water splash, tools, and worker clothing
3. Spores germinate on leaf surface in high humidity (>85% RH)
4. Fungus enters through stomata (no wounds needed)
5. Colonization of mesophyll tissue; sporulation within 10-14 days
6. Massive spore production enables rapid secondary spread

## Impact
- Yield losses of 20-50% in greenhouse production
- Reduced photosynthesis due to massive leaf area loss
- Fruit quality reduction from sunscald and size reduction
- Difficult to eradicate from greenhouses once established

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Greenhouse and polyhouse tomato production regions
- Maharashtra (Pune, Satara — polyhouse cultivation)
- Tropical highlands with moderate temperatures and high humidity
- Common problem in protected cultivation worldwide
