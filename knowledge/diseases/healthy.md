# Healthy Tomato Plant

## Overview
A healthy tomato plant shows no signs of disease, pest damage, or nutritional deficiency. Healthy leaves are uniformly green, firm, and turgid with no spots, yellowing, curling, or wilting.

## Characteristics of a Healthy Plant
- **Leaves:** Uniformly dark green, flat or slightly curved, no spots, lesions, or discoloration
- **Stems:** Firm, upright, green to slightly hairy, no dark streaks or lesions
- **Growth:** Vigorous upward and lateral growth with strong branching
- **Roots:** White to light tan, extensive, with no discoloration or rot
- **Flowers:** Abundant yellow flowers, good pollination, minimal drop
- **Fruits:** Even sizing, smooth skin, uniform ripening

## Key Nutritional Requirements
- **Nitrogen (N):** Promotes vegetative growth — deficiency causes pale green leaves starting from bottom
- **Phosphorus (P):** Root development and fruit quality — deficiency causes purple-tinged leaves
- **Potassium (K):** Fruit quality and disease resistance — deficiency causes brown leaf margins
- **Calcium (Ca):** Cell wall strength — deficiency causes blossom end rot
- **Magnesium (Mg):** Chlorophyll production — deficiency causes interveinal yellowing

## Optimal Growing Conditions
- **Temperature:** 21-27°C (70-80°F) daytime; 15-20°C (59-68°F) nighttime
- **Soil pH:** 6.0-6.8
- **Watering:** Consistent, deep watering at the base of the plant; avoid overhead irrigation
- **Sunlight:** Full sun — 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day
- **Spacing:** 45-60 cm between plants for good air circulation

## Preventive Care to Maintain Health
1. **Crop rotation:** Do not plant tomatoes in the same soil for 3-4 years
2. **Certified seed:** Use disease-free, certified seeds or transplants
3. **Mulching:** Apply mulch to reduce soil splash and conserve moisture
4. **Pruning:** Remove suckers and lower leaves to improve air circulation
5. **Irrigation:** Use drip irrigation to keep leaves dry
6. **Sanitation:** Remove and destroy crop debris after harvest
7. **Scouting:** Check plants weekly for early signs of disease or pest damage
8. **Nutrition:** Balanced fertilization based on soil test results

## When Prediction is "Healthy"
If the model predicts "healthy" with high confidence, this indicates:
- No visible disease symptoms on the leaf image
- The model does not detect patterns associated with any of the 9 disease classes
- The plant is likely in good condition, but regular monitoring is still recommended

## Important Note
Even when a plant appears healthy:
- Continue regular scouting for early detection of emerging problems
- Maintain preventive spray schedules during high-risk weather
- Monitor weather forecasts for conditions favorable to disease outbreaks
- A healthy appearance today does not guarantee health tomorrow
