# Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans)

## Overview
Late blight is one of the most devastating plant diseases in history — it caused the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s. It can destroy an entire tomato crop within days under favorable conditions. This oomycete pathogen spreads rapidly and aggressively.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Phytophthora infestans
- **Type:** Oomycete (water mold, not a true fungus)
- **Survival:** Survives in infected potato tubers, volunteer plants, and on plant debris. Does NOT survive long in soil without living tissue.

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Large, irregularly shaped, water-soaked, pale green to dark brown lesions, often starting at leaf tips and margins. White fuzzy sporulation visible on the underside of leaves in humid conditions.
- **Stems:** Dark brown to black greasy-looking lesions that can girdle the stem.
- **Fruits:** Large, firm, brown, greasy-looking lesions with a rough texture. Affected fruit eventually becomes a soggy, foul-smelling mass.
- **Progression:** Extremely rapid — can destroy entire plants in 7-10 days. Entire fields can be lost within 2-3 weeks.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 10-25°C (50-77°F) — cool to moderate temperatures
- **Humidity:** >90% relative humidity, persistent fog, or prolonged leaf wetness
- **Spread:** Wind-dispersed sporangia can travel 10-20 km
- **Season:** Late monsoon/post-monsoon (September-November in India), cool wet conditions

## Disease Cycle
1. Sporangia produced on infected plants are wind-dispersed
2. In cool conditions (<15°C), sporangia release zoospores that swim to infection sites
3. In warmer conditions, sporangia germinate directly
4. Infection occurs within 4-6 hours of leaf wetness
5. New sporangia produced within 3-5 days
6. Multiple generations per week in ideal conditions — explosive epidemics

## Impact
- Can cause 100% crop loss if untreated
- Most destructive tomato disease worldwide
- Fruit infection makes entire harvest unmarketable
- Requires immediate action upon first detection

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra hill regions (Mahabaleshwar, Panchgani, Satara)
- North Indian plains during winter
- All temperate and subtropical regions with cool, humid weather
- Particularly severe at high altitudes and in greenhouse environments
