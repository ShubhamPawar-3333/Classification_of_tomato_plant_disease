# Septoria Leaf Spot (Septoria lycopersici)

## Overview
Septoria leaf spot is one of the most common foliar diseases of tomato. It causes numerous small, circular spots with dark borders and light gray centers. While it rarely kills plants, severe defoliation significantly reduces yield.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Septoria lycopersici
- **Type:** Fungus (Ascomycete)
- **Survival:** Survives in infected plant debris, on solanaceous weeds, and on seed surfaces

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Numerous small (2-5 mm), roughly circular spots with dark brown margins and grayish-white centers. Tiny black dots (pycnidia — fruiting bodies) visible in the center of spots under magnification. Heavily spotted leaves turn yellow, brown, and eventually fall off.
- **Stems:** Rarely affected, but elongated lesions may appear.
- **Fruits:** Not directly affected, but defoliation leads to sunscald on exposed fruits.
- **Progression:** First appears on lower, older leaves after fruit set. Progresses rapidly upward during wet weather.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 20-25°C (68-77°F) — moderate temperatures
- **Humidity:** High relative humidity with frequent rain or heavy dew
- **Leaf wetness:** Minimum 48 hours of continuous leaf wetness for infection
- **Season:** Most severe during wet monsoon season; can occur anytime with prolonged moisture

## Disease Cycle
1. Fungus overwinters in infected crop debris and solanaceous weeds
2. Conidia (spores) released from pycnidia during rain events
3. Spores splash onto lower leaves and germinate in free moisture
4. Penetration through stomata; symptoms appear in 5-10 days
5. New pycnidia form in lesion centers; produce thousands of spores
6. Secondary spread by rain splash throughout the season

## Impact
- Yield losses of 30-50% from severe defoliation
- Reduced fruit size and delayed maturity
- Sunscald on exposed fruits
- Common co-infection with Early Blight — combined damage is more severe

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra (all tomato-growing districts)
- Common in all warm, humid tomato-growing regions
- Particularly severe in rain-fed tomato production
- One of the most frequently observed diseases in Indian tomato fields
