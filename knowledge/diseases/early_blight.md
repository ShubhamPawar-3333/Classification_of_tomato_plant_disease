# Early Blight (Alternaria solani)

## Overview
Early blight is one of the most prevalent foliar diseases of tomato worldwide. Despite its name, it can occur at any stage of plant development. It causes characteristic concentric ring-patterned lesions on leaves, stems, and fruits.

## Pathogen
- **Organism:** Alternaria solani (also A. tomatophila)
- **Type:** Fungus (Deuteromycete)
- **Survival:** Overwinters in infected plant debris, soil, and on seed surfaces. Can survive 1-2 years in soil.

## Symptoms
- **Leaves:** Dark brown to black lesions with concentric rings forming a "target spot" or "bull's-eye" pattern. Lesions are typically 6-12 mm and often surrounded by a chlorotic (yellow) halo. Older, lower leaves are affected first.
- **Stems:** Dark, sunken, elongated lesions near the soil line (collar rot in seedlings) or on stems of mature plants.
- **Fruits:** Leathery, dark, sunken lesions at the stem end of the fruit with concentric rings. Usually occurs on mature green to ripe fruit.
- **Progression:** Disease starts on oldest leaves and progresses upward. Severe defoliation exposes fruits to sunscald.

## Favorable Conditions
- **Temperature:** 24-29°C (75-84°F) — optimal for spore germination and infection
- **Humidity:** Prolonged leaf wetness (>6 hours), high relative humidity
- **Plant stress:** Nitrogen deficiency, heavy fruit load, or poor nutrition increases susceptibility
- **Season:** Warm, humid weather with alternating wet and dry periods

## Disease Cycle
1. Fungus overwinters as mycelium or conidia in infected plant debris
2. Conidia (spores) are dispersed by wind, rain splash, and irrigation water
3. Spores land on leaves and germinate in presence of free moisture
4. Infection occurs through direct penetration or through wounds
5. Lesions develop within 5-7 days; new spores are produced on lesion surface
6. Secondary spread continues throughout the season

## Impact
- Yield losses of 35-78% in severe epidemics
- Premature defoliation reduces fruit size and quality
- Sunscald on exposed fruits
- Post-harvest fruit rot from infected fruits

## Regions Commonly Affected
- Maharashtra (Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune)
- All tropical and subtropical tomato-growing regions
- Particularly severe in areas with warm, humid climates
- Common in both field and greenhouse production
